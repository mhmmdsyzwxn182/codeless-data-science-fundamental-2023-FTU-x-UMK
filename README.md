The number of seizures for 2018 according to the type of counterfeit goods using Knime.

## Abstract:
The report will present about counterfeit goods pose a significant challenge to global economies, consumer safety, and intellectual property rights. In 2018, understanding the landscape of counterfeit products and their distribution by type is crucial for effective law enforcement, brand protection, and policy development. This study aims to analyze the number of seizures of counterfeit goods in 2018 across various categories. By examining these seizures, we can gain valuable insights into the dynamics of counterfeit markets, potential threats to public health and safety, and the industries most affected by counterfeiting. This research utilizes data from authoritative sources to provide a comprehensive overview of the counterfeit goods landscape in 2018.

## Introduction:
Counterfeit goods, imitation products that infringe upon trademarks and intellectual property rights, have become pervasive in today's global marketplace. These counterfeit items not only undermine brand reputation and revenue but also pose serious risks to consumers who unknowingly purchase substandard and potentially hazardous goods. In order to combat the proliferation of counterfeit products effectively, it is essential to have a clear understanding of their prevalence and distribution.
The year 2018 marked a crucial juncture in the ongoing battle against counterfeit goods. Governments, law enforcement agencies, and brand owners sought to curb the production and distribution of these illicit items, safeguarding consumers and industries alike. To achieve this goal, it was imperative to collect and analyze data on the types of counterfeit goods being seized during this period.


## Methodology:
This study employs a comprehensive methodology to analyze the number of seizures of counterfeit goods for the year 2018 according to their respective types. The following steps outline the approach taken to gather, process, and analyze the data:

1. Data Collection:
Data Sources: The data is from dataset https://archive.data.gov.my/data/ms_MY/dataset/jumlah-rampasan-bagi-tahun-2018-mengikut-jenis-barang-tiruan 
	Government Agencies. Data on seizures of counterfeit goods were obtained from relevant government agencies responsible for customs enforcement, intellectual property rights protection, and law enforcement. These agencies typically maintain records of seizures made at borders, ports, and within domestic markets.

2. Data Reprocessing:
	Before analysis, you will need to clean and pre-process the data to ensure its quality and consistency. Handling missing data. Removing duplicates and irrelevant columns. Standardizing or normalizing data, if necessary.
	Use KNIME's data exploration tools to gain insights into the dataset. Explore summary statistics, distributions, and correlations between variables to understand the data's characteristics.

3. Data Transformation:
	Prepare the data for analysis by transforming it as needed. This step may involve. One-hot encoding categorical variables for example is a product category. Aggregating data to get the total number of seizures for each product category in 2018.

4. Data Visualization:
	Create visualizations to present your findings effectively. KNIME offers various visualization nodes to create charts, graphs, and plots that help you convey the results clearly. After that perform statistical analyses to identify trends and patterns in the data.
